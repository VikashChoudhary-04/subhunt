# Subhunt

**Subhunt** is a fast, minimal, and reliable **active subdomain enumeration tool** built using **DNS over HTTPS (DoH)**.

It is designed for **real-world reconnaissance** where traditional DNS (UDP/53), passive data sources, or large recon frameworks are unreliable, blocked, or noisy.

Subhunt focuses on **correctness, clarity, and clean CLI behavior**.

## ✨ Features

- 🚀 Active subdomain bruteforce enumeration  
- 🌐 DNS over HTTPS (Cloudflare DoH)  
- ⚡ Concurrent scanning with configurable threads  
- 📊 Single live status line (no spam, no flicker)  
- 🔎 Results printed immediately when found  
- 🧩 Wordlist-agnostic (SecLists, Assetnote, custom lists)  
- 🧼 Zero false positives (live DNS verification)  
- 🤫 `--quiet` mode for automation and pipelines  
- 🧪 Meaningful exit codes for scripting  

---

## 🧠 Design Philosophy

Subhunt is intentionally **simple and opinionated**.

- **Active enumeration only**
- **No passive data sources** (no crt.sh, APIs, or third-party datasets)
- **Wordlists are external data**, not part of the tool
- **Accuracy over noise**

If Subhunt prints a subdomain, **it exists at scan time**.

## 📦 Installation

### Requirements

- Go **1.20+**
- Internet access (HTTPS required for DNS over HTTPS)

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/VikashChoudhary-04/subhunt.git
cd subhunt
```

> ⚠️ If `git clone` is slow or fails on restricted networks, use:
> - a different network (mobile hotspot / home Wi-Fi)
> - or GitHub Web UI → **Download ZIP**

## 🚀 Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
go run ./cmd/subhunt \
  -d example.com \
  --bruteforce /path/to/wordlist.txt
```

### Increase Concurrency

```bash
go run ./cmd/subhunt \
  -d example.com \
  --bruteforce /path/to/wordlist.txt \
  --threads 100
```

### Quiet Mode (Results Only)

```bash
go run ./cmd/subhunt \
  -d example.com \
  --bruteforce /path/to/wordlist.txt \
  --quiet
```

---

## 📊 Output Behavior

### Live Status Line (stderr)

```text
[RUNNING] Tested: 4214 | Found: 19 | Rate: 247/s
```

- Single line
- Updated in place
- Never duplicated
- Never mixed with results

### Results (stdout)

```text
[+] www.example.com
[+] api.example.com
```

- Printed immediately when found
- Always start on a new line
- Safe for piping into other tools

---

## 🔄 Exit Codes

Subhunt uses **automation-friendly exit codes**:

| Condition | Exit Code |
|--------|-----------|
| At least one subdomain found | `0` |
| No subdomains found | `1` |
| Invalid usage | `1` |

### Example

```bash
subhunt ... && echo "Subdomains found"
```

## 📁 Wordlists

Subhunt **does not bundle wordlists**.

You are expected to use **community-maintained wordlists**, such as:

- SecLists  
- Assetnote  
- ProjectDiscovery  
- OWASP Amass  
- Bug bounty curated lists  

See [README](wordlists/README.md) for:
- Recommended wordlists (as of 2026)
- Usage guidance
- Warnings about numeric-only lists

### Example (SecLists)

```bash
go run ./cmd/subhunt \
  -d example.com \
  --bruteforce /usr/share/wordlists/seclists/Discovery/DNS/subdomains-top1million-5000.txt
```

---

## ⚠️ Common Mistakes

- ❌ Expecting every domain to expose many subdomains  
- ❌ Using numeric-only lists directly  
- ❌ Assuming “no output” means the tool failed  

> Numeric lists are typically used for **permutations**, not raw bruteforce.

---

## 🧪 Quick Sanity Test

```bash
echo www > test.txt
go run ./cmd/subhunt -d yahoo.com --bruteforce test.txt
```

Expected output:

```text
[+] www.yahoo.com
```

Check exit code:

```bash
echo $?
# 0
```
